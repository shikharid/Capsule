#Problem Statement
Existing systems are designed from a solver point-of-view, i.e.,  most of the functionality revolves around making the problem solver  comfortable with the system as easily as possible. On the other end, all of the few existing systems are designed assuming that the problem setter has an intricate knowledge of the system.
On the global level, the existing web based compilers/judges are either paid hence introducing financial constraints. 

##Motivation
A simple yet powerful web based evaluation system is required with the plagiarism check functionality for the code, amongst others. With our main focus on making an easily configurable judging platform.

##Objective
The conceptualized platform is centred around an online judge system, which serves for the automatic assessment of user-submitted programs. Some of its most important features include:
-	support for basic programming languages such as C/C++, Java
-	a flexible testing system, supporting dynamic interaction with submitted programs and highly customisable output of assessment results.

##Scope of the Project
Since the system aims at generating results and simplify the process of code evaluation as per the specified input structure, the web based system enables the user to increase through put and efficiently grade submissions.
